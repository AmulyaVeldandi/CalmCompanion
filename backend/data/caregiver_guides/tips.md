# Caregiver Tips (Local Corpus)

## Orientation & Calm Voice
Speak slowly, use the person's name, and gently re-orient: where they are, the day/time, and what is about to happen. Acknowledge feelings before offering options.

## Reduce Stimuli
Lower TV/music volume, reduce bright lights and clutter, and move to a quieter space. Offer one or two simple choices and time to respond.

## Comfort & Pain Check
Agitation can mask discomfort. Check for pain, hunger, thirst, bathroom needs, temperature, clothing tightness, or nausea. Suggest a brief rest.

## Routine & Step-by-Step
Keep routines predictable. Break tasks into 1â€“2 simple steps. Use short, clear phrases and visual cues. Praise small successes.

## Social & Music
Try a brief friendly chat, a favorite song, or a short walk. Choose familiar activities with low effort and positive associations.

## Sleep Hygiene
Aim for daytime light exposure and gentle activity. Avoid late caffeine. Wind down with calming music and minimal screens.

## Environment (Noise & Light)
Soften lighting to reduce glare and shadows. Close curtains at dusk to reduce reflections. Reduce noise or relocate to a quiet room.

## Hydration & Snacks
Offer small sips of water and a simple snack. Dehydration can worsen confusion and irritability.

## Bathroom Routine
Ask gently about bathroom needs and provide privacy. Prepare clear cues (signs, lights) and easy paths.

## Gentle Choices
When overwhelmed, offer one or two options and time to respond. Avoid rapid-fire questions or corrections.
